# Setting Up Your Environment

To run this code, you'll need to have Python, NumPy, and SciPy installed on your computer. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment:

Install Python: You can download the latest version of Python from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Install NumPy and SciPy: NumPy and SciPy are required to generate the sine wave and write it to a .wav file. You can install them using pip, which is a package manager for Python. Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux) and run the following command:

Copy code
pip install numpy scipy
This will install both NumPy and SciPy.

Run the code: Once you have Python, NumPy, and SciPy installed, you can run the code by opening it in a Python environment or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, or Spyder, or by running it in a terminal using the python command followed by the name of the Python file.

For example, if you have saved the code in a file called sine_wave.py, you can run it from a terminal using the following command:

Copy code
python sine_wave.py
This will execute the code and generate a .wav file with the specified parameters.

Additional notes: Depending on your operating system and Python installation, you may need to install additional dependencies such as pyaudio or sounddevice to be able to play the generated .wav file. These dependencies can also be installed using pip.

You may also want to include information on how to run the code with different user-defined parameters, as well as any other relevant details about the code and its use.
